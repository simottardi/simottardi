### Hi there 👋

I am Simone, here are some facts about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on derma-app, an application for patients to track their eczema and medications. I reccomend visiting the repos.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... well, one never stops learning, but GraphQL and Google Vision are the two technologies on the top of my list.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I find fun to develop and delivers value to the users.
- 💬 Ask me about biotech, and public funding, innovation management. 
- 📫 How to reach me: shoot me an email in English or Italian at simottardi@gmail.com, and if you like to help me practice my Dutch, we can try also with that!
